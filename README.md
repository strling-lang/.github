  <h3>Readable. Composable. Universal.</h3>
  
  <p>
    <strong>STRling</strong> is the next-generation pattern language designed to replace Regular Expressions. 
    It transforms pattern matching from a write-only cryptographic puzzle into a readable, type-safe, and maintainable engineering discipline.

## 🔔 The Ecosystem Map

We are building a complete "Pattern Sovereign" universe. Here is how our repositories are structured:

| Repository                                                                           | Role           | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[`strling`](https://github.com/strling-lang/strling)**                             | **The Engine** | The core compiler, LSP, CLI, and the **18 certified language bindings**. This is where the code lives.                                     |
| **[`research-intelligence`](https://github.com/strling-lang/research-intelligence)** | **The Brain**  | Our strategic think-tank. We use deep research to identify "Representability Gaps" in modern software and design the features to fix them. |
| **[`manual`](https://github.com/strling-lang/manual)**                               | **The Wisdom** | _The Masters Manual to Patterns_. A pedagogical guide to wielding pattern theory, moving beyond simple syntax into architectural design.   |
| **[`.github`](https://github.com/strling-lang/.github)**                             | **The Law**    | Organization-wide governance, contribution guidelines, and security policies.                                                              |

## 🎯 Our Mission: "Junior First"

STRling is built on a simple promise: **A Junior Developer should be able to read, understand, and modify a complex pattern without fear.**

- **No more cryptic syntax:** Replace `(?<=\d{3})` with `lookbehind(digit.repeated(3))`.
- **No more ReDoS:** Our compiler guarantees safety via Static Symbolic Derivatives.
- **No more platform lock-in:** Write once, emit to Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and 14 others.

## 🤝 Contributing & Governance

We welcome "Wielders" of all skill levels. Because STRling is a foundational tool, we adhere to strict engineering standards to ensure stability.

- **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/strling-lang/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**: Our promise of a welcoming, harassment-free community.
- **[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/strling-lang/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)**: The "Golden Path" for getting your PR merged, including the **Omega Audit** requirements.
- **[Security Policy](https://github.com/strling-lang/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md)**: How to responsibly report compiler vulnerabilities or ReDoS bypasses.
