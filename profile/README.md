  <h3>Readable. Composable. Universal.</h3>
  
  <p>
    <strong>STRling</strong> is the next-generation pattern language designed to replace Regular Expressions. 
    It transforms pattern matching from a write-only cryptographic puzzle into a readable, type-safe, and maintainable engineering discipline.

## 🎯 Our Mission: "Junior First"

STRling is built on a simple promise: **A Junior Developer should be able to read, understand, and modify a complex pattern without fear.**

- **No more cryptic syntax:** Replace `(?<=\d{3})` with `lookbehind(digit.repeated(3))`.
- **No more ReDoS:** Our compiler guarantees safety via Static Symbolic Derivatives.
- **No more platform lock-in:** Write once, emit to Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and 14 others.
